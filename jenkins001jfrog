Creating an Artifactory Server Instance 


rtServer (
    id: 'Artifactory-1',
    url: 'http://my-artifactory-domain/artifactory',
    // If you're using username and password:
    username: 'user',
    password: 'password',
    // If you're using Credentials ID:
    credentialsId: 'ccrreeddeennttiiaall',
    // If Jenkins is configured to use an http proxy, you can bypass the proxy when using this Artifactory server:
    bypassProxy: true,
    // Configure the connection timeout (in seconds).
    // The default value (if not configured) is 300 seconds:
    timeout: 300
